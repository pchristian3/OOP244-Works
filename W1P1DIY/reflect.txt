__________________________________________________________________________________________

During the workshop, I reviewed the final solutions for each deliverable and revisited the 
relevant parts of the course notes. I ensured that I understood the concepts covered in the 
workshop.

In Deliverable 1, I implemented various string manipulation functions such as strCpy, strnCpy, 
strCmp, strnCmp, strLen, strStr, and strCat. These functions involved tasks like copying strings, 
comparing strings, finding substrings, and concatenating strings. I carefully examined each function,
considered the logic behind it, and made necessary improvements to ensure correctness and efficiency.

By rereading the related parts of the course notes, I reinforced my understanding of string manipulation, 
memory allocation, and dealing with pointers. I ensured that I grasped concepts like null-terminating strings, 
pointer arithmetic, and iterating through strings using pointers.

Overall, this exercise allowed me to deepen my knowledge and strengthen my skills in string manipulation
and memory management in C++. I feel confident in my understanding of the workshop concepts and ready to 
apply them in practical programming scenarios.
