I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

In this workshop was mostly based on inheritance. In this workshop the concept of Inheritance is used in a very great manner which 
lead me to sharpen my skills. In this workshop the base class is MotorVehicle and the derived class is Truck. In this workshop the 
derived calss inherits the properties and behaviours of the base class and can add its own unique properties and behaviour or modify 
the ones which are inherited from the base class. 

Also in this week's workshop I learned about custom input and outpur operator which can be also said as i/o operators. 
In this workshop I defined the output function which is "<<" and the input function which is ">>". Instead of any iostream
this workshop is executed where the input and output functions were done by me. 

This workshop is the perfect combination to undertsand the concepts of inheritance, shadowing as well as i/o operators.
