I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

In this workshop 2 DIY submission I used the concepts of the things which I learned 
in the class on Wednesday. The main concept which I learnd during the 
class was dynamic memory allocation and deallocation. In this workshop it 
played a very important part as in a function we are using dynamic memory 
concpet to make this code run in a proper way without any errors.
Also, during this week I also learned about the Function Overloading. 
Function overloading means we are creating a function of same name but 
we are passing different parameters every time when we call that function.
This workshop turned out to be very useful in that. The concept of the 
function overload in the DIY part of this workshop can be understand as I 
created two load function which turns out to be a perfect example for function overload 
as both have the same name but different parameters.
