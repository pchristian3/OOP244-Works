This workshop was based on inheritance concept which I found it very easy 
as while this concept was taught in the class I was very attentive 
this workshop is the best way to understand the concept of inheritance. 
Inheritance can be simply means that you copy the same structure to another
structure or class. The copied class is known as the derived class and the 
class which was copied is known as base class. 

There are many concepts in inheritance which was covered during the lecture 
and also the workshop. I have understood this concept perfectly now.
