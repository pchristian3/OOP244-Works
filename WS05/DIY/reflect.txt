I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

In this week I mostly learned about Operator Overloadin in C++ which allows us to 
redefine the behaviour for a user defined types. In this week module, I leared that I
can overload most of the operators, including arithmetic operators. Both of the workshops 
which is DIY and the labs containes a good amout of practice of this weekely topic. 
To overload an operator, you define a specail member function called an operator 
function. 
Operator overload can be simply explained as by overloading, you can specify how it 
should behaver for your specific class or the data type. It has the same name yet 
the arguments passed to it would be differnt the function of it would be different.
