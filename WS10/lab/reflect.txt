I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

This is the last workshop of this course and I was quite nervous as well as quite exicited for this workshop as it shows 
the end of the course but also it is a sign of finals coming up. This workshop was a quite easy one compaired to other 
workshops to be honest. In this workshop I created two tempelate in the searchNlist module. The first template
function which I made is a search function which is of type bool and recieves 4 arguments and the  implemenatation 
of this function is given in the same moudule by me as well the another tempelate function which I created 
is listArrayElements which is of void type and recieves three arguments. I just followed what was written 
in the description of what I needed to do in the workshop at first when I needed to edit the main.cpp file
I got a little bit tensed as I have never done that but I figured it out that I just only need to give 
the necessary arguments to the function then it will be all good. I had some trouble in showing all the students 
part but I figured that out too. Overall, this workshop was a easy one.
