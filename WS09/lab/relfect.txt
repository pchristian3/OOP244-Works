I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

The main purpose of this workshop is to read from a file with the help of C++.
This workshop helped me to understand the key concpets of standard libray.
Also as the finals are coming up this was a good way to brush up my skills on
copy constructor, assignment operator and destructor which is also known as 
the rule of three. Also I faced some errors in this Workshop but I was able to 
solve it.
