I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

This week I basically learned about class independence in object-oriented programming and the need of 
resource management. I discovered resource instance pointers and dynamically allocated RAM. It distinguishes 
between deep and shallow copying and emphasises the relevance of deep copying for resource variables.

This week also covered the copy constructor and copy assignment operator, which are responsible for copying 
data between objects. It recommends localising common code and dealing with transitory objects, and it forbids
copying in certain class designs.

In addition, the ppt presentation presented input/output operators, compositions, and associations in class, 
as well as their relationships. It describes how to utilise the iostream and fstream header files for
standard and file input/ output operations, respectively.

Lastly, I learned about design considerations, such as flexibility in selecting stream objects and resolving
scope for classes and objects defined in header files.
In summary, this week was an overview of resource management, deep copying, input/output operations, and design considerations in C++.
