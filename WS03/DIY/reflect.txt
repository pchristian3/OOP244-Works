I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

In this week I mostly learned about Encapsulation. It moslty hides impementation details 
form the clients. Also in this week I learned about member functions, adding a member
function and privacy.

This workshop was the combination of all the things which I learned in the class as well
as I learned from the reading material for this week. Moreover, in this workshop I got to
know about many different types of iostream functions such as width, fill, setf and unsetf.
This workshop turned out to be very exiciting and also very helpful. To ensure the privacy
we first call the set function and then assign the values to the member variables in them. 
This is not only a example of good practice but also it ensures that by no one outside of 
the code can perform any change to the member variables. For example: In the DIY part of 
this worksop for the food module. We create public varibales / functions such as 
setEmpty, set, setCalories etc and there are also private member functions / variables 
which are food name, the number of calories and the time for it to consume and setName 
function which holds a very important part in this workshop. The setName function is 
used to set the name of the food by passing the pointer array and it is backed up by 
strnCpy which is a cstring libray function. Overall, this workshop made me understand 
a lot of things about privacy and how to access member function in a class even though 
they are private or public.
